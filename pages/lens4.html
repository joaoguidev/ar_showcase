                        Well, the first Half-life is full of neat little traps
                        placed all around you that you have to navigate around
                        using your many senses to notice in the first place,
                        although mostly just sight to be honest. For example,
                        quite early on in the game you come across a corridor
                        that bends to the right which has an alarm laser on the
                        floor right before the corridor turns, water on the
                        floor, and an open elevator shaft. By analyzing the
                        terrain you see that by jumping over the laser alarm
                        normally you will slip on the water and fall down the
                        shaft. So, because you used your amazing sense of sight,
                        you are able to plan ahead, shift a bit to the right and
                        then when you jump and then slip you slam into the wall
                        next to the elevator door rather than falling through
                        it. Hurrah for eyes!
