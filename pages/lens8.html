                        Half-Life has some very different parts of the game at
                        the beginning the player is just trying to make it to
                        the surface for help, then when the player sees that
                        nobody is coming to help they have to go back and try to
                        fix the main problem the next part of the game goes
                        in-between large parts of exploration and dense fire
                        fights with enemy soldiers throughout the game the
                        fighting with the soldiers will get more and more
                        difficult as the player can be killed very fast by the
                        soldiers with little chance to dodge any gunfire without
                        any cover like the player can with the monsters.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Next the player is above ground fighting against an
                        endless number of soldiers moving from gun fight to gun
                        fight, before again entering a different part of black
                        mesa, the difficulty really ramps up here as the player
                        will encounter more soldiers then before and then when
                        the player gets to the other dimension the difficulty
                        will become even harder, the end game is full of areas
                        that require jumping around many difficult things at
                        either take massive chunks of health of instantly kill
                        the player if they fail any jump.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Difficulty wise the game is only rising interest with
                        harder fights and punishing parkour, however the harder
                        gunfights aren't so bad, the fights are harder but by
                        the time the player reaches the gun fights with the
                        soldiers outside for the second time, they already have
                        every gun making it really fun to do crazy stunts or
                        quickly change you weapon to control the battlefield.
                        The game is paced well with many opportunities to heal
                        and rest before exploring or fighting again and each
                        area is different with something that wasnâ€™t in the
                        last, at the end of the game the player has a boss fight
                        against a creepy monster that almost looks like a
                        deformed baby with a large head.
