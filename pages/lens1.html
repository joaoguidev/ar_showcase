                        Mechanics: The game has you set sneaking through the
                        Black mesa facility to try to get out safely. So the
                        player had to interact with a lot of things. The source
                        engine really helps make the game interactable. The
                        whole mechanics were to break through boxes and move and
                        shoot things so you can traverse through the facility.
                        You would have to use the brilliant mind of the
                        scientist Gordon freeman. Even though traversing the
                        facility was a linear path you still had to interact
                        with items like solving a puzzle to continue on.

                        Story: The storytelling is the reason why Half life is
                        one of the most liked games out there for its time. Half
                        life didn't tell its story line strictly through cut
                        scenes like most games among the times. You as the
                        player could overhear conversation from other scientists
                        or talk to other scientists. So as if it were real life
                        and you were walking to your job like Morgan freeman was
                        you would learn from walking around and talking or not.
                        Not only this but the story itself was spectacular and
                        the way they got the story across was perfect. The story
                        was about a secret government base where top researchers
                        were brought to conduct experiments for the government
                        but something goes wrong and you as the player must
                        figure out how to fix things.

                        Aesthetics: What made half life look so aesthetically
                        pleasing was the source engine that valve made. This
                        engine changed the way games were made and played across
                        the world. This engine not only gave more accessibility
                        to the game developers but also the players. From the
                        way it rendered objects to the freedom of design the
                        user had with the engine was unlike anything at the
                        time. Later on valve released the source engine to the
                        public to play with and got lots of inspiration from the
                        community for later games such as TF2.

                        Technology: The interaction with the AI really changed
                        how a players game was laid out. While running through
                        the Black Mesa facility the player will come across some
                        police and scientists. When you interact with these
                        chacterters they will have a few voice lines following
                        their personal traits but that's the cool part. Like
                        real life you can ask these people to either come and
                        help you or follow you to stay still or mostly anything
                        that could help your situation. So having a policeman
                        with a gun would be handy because he could help you
                        combat other enemies you might encounter but because the
                        AI wasn't the smartest you didn't want it following you
                        through a land mine field because he would most likely
                        kill you and himself. It helped with the storyline
                        because it made the game feel more realistic. While
                        running through the facility you would find people and
                        interact with them and they would all be the same for
                        obvious reasons.

                        Half life perfectly used all four of these types when it
                        came out. These four elements really help support
                        another to overall lift the game and make it a gaming
                        master piece.
