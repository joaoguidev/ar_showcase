                        During a Half-Life playthrough the player (including me)
                        can have many feelings that can range from confusion to
                        angry, at least for me that’s how it went. One important
                        moment was soon after the player kills the large
                        tentacle monster they are making their way to and old
                        passageway and inside of this huge room there is a
                        monster probably 20ft tall and shooting lasers or
                        something from its arms during this moment the player
                        has no chance of shooting it and killing it as it rips
                        through your health at an extremely fast pace. However,
                        the player must get past it to continue the game so
                        running across the large room into a small one the
                        monster can't fit through. During a Half-Life
                        playthrough the player (including me) can have many
                        feelings that can range from confusion to angry, at
                        least for me that’s how it went. One important moment

                        During this whole encounter the player is at first
                        surprised, this is the second large monster in their way
                        but way more deadly than when they don’t see any choice
                        but to fight it the player is shocked by how much damage
                        the monster does, the player decides to just blitz it
                        but is scared the plan is dumb and will fail. All these
                        different emotions raise the tension in a game although
                        it could seem like unwanted stress this is
                        action-adventure game so if fighting the monster didn’t
                        work the play has to hope there is some puzzle to beat
                        the monster so he can press on, this whole unexpected
                        fight with something too strong can be very exciting for
                        the player and make them understand the power dynamic
                        the game is building.
