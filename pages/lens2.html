                        The experience Half life gave a player in 2004 was like
                        no other in its time. The game had an awesome sensation
                        of audio. Anyone who has played the game or has even
                        been on the internet since that time knows the sound of
                        the classic crowbar that you use in the game as your
                        main tool. There was just something about the sound of
                        swinging that crowbar and smashing crates that audibly
                        is pleasurable to the player. The game plays a lot
                        through memory as the more you traverse the game the
                        more knowledge you learn on what is happening around
                        you. The more you go further in the game the more
                        secrets you find out to help fully understand what is
                        happening while the facility falls in chaos around you.
                    </p>

                        The challenges and puzzles in Half life are what really
                        get a player thinking. Due to the facility falling apart
                        or being raided by the US Army you have to figure a way
                        to get across such difficult levels of terrain without
                        dying just so you can get further into escaping. The
                        last piece is the emotion you get from this game. All
                        game all you can think is to escape and survive but the
                        further and further you go into this game you figure out
                        all the enemies that the US Army was sent to destroy are
                        under mind control and need to be released so there
                        isn't a massive war between civilization and the outer
                        world. You get to feel really sorry so using that
                        massive brain of yours you find a way to escape your own
                        reality to go to a different world and defeat the one
                        who has set all his people under mind slavery. Saving
                        both the human and intergalactic species.
