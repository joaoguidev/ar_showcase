                        Half life impacted the game industry in a way that no
                        other developers could have imagined. A new feature they
                        added to the game is storytelling without shoving it
                        down the players throat. So instead of fighting the
                        player by taking away game play with cinematics to tell
                        the story or dialogue that couldn't be skipped half life
                        told its story in a different way. The player would
                        learn the story line by naturally progressing through
                        the game from either talking to NPC characters like
                        other games or unlike other games pick up little pieces
                        from eavesdropping from NPC talking to one another. Like
                        real life you can walk past a group of people and get a
                        little of what they're talking about even if it wasn't
                        your intention. So using this realistic feature Half
                        Life was able to tell its story without forcing the
                        player to learn it.

                        They would naturally grow and learn it as the game went
                        on from the actions they made. Cinematics were now used
                        more successfully because instead of being wasted on
                        catching the player up in the story lounge it could be
                        used for anything the developers wanted to help make the
                        game more successful. Half life sold 9.3 million copies
                        by the year 2008 and had made a big influence on the
                        market we see today. A game made in more modern time was
                        influenced by Half Life was the game Heartworm. This low
                        poly 3D survival game took graphical inspirations from
                        Half Life. So even still to this day Half life inspires
                        other game makers in their craft.
