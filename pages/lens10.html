                        In Half life there are multiple ways to traverse through
                        core areas to get to the next one. The player can play
                        in many different ways. They can play the game super
                        safe and slow or fast and hectic not only that but the
                        player can also play the way they think the character
                        Gordon Freeman would traverse through the Black Mesa
                        facility. Each way played brings different challenges
                        and game opportunities.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The game is designed pretty good with the use of the AI.
                        From being able to either get AI to help or make your
                        life harder you can change how you get through the level
                        alive. Like some people might play as long as they stay
                        alive that is all that matters but some other people
                        might want to make sure all the NPC characters stay
                        alive because they are scientists as well.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The game doesn't really support one play style more than
                        the other then just to stay alive. The way the player
                        decides to beat each area is mostly from the player's
                        decision where the game just directs them where to go.
                        The playstyle of a player will most likely change with
                        what task they are given at hand. So some levels you
                        might want to sneak around enemies because it's easier
                        than other levels. It is just easier to kill everything
                        this is what keeps the game fresh as the player will
                        come to these decisions on their own and will always
                        have action but also make strategic decisions when it
                        matters.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The game helps the player improve as time progressive
                        because as the game goes on the enemies and puzzles get
                        harder and more interesting. So the player improves
                        every little bit with each new challenge so when they
                        reach the final level they are smart enough on how to
                        play the game to maneuver and outsmart whatever comes
                        their way. The environment is quite spectacular as every
                        room and outdoor area you go to is quite different. Each
                        research room is set up differently for their own
                        research and the facilities utilities are set up in a
                        way you would think they actually work. Like when you
                        need to go back into the facility you sneak in by going
                        through the water treatment plant in the facility.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        So to do so you must open and close valves to control
                        water flow and open hatches.So ares like this there
                        isn't much player option because if the player wants to
                        traverse something like a dangerous water treatment
                        plant they must make the perfect moves to survive but in
                        parts will it isn't life or death the player has free
                        choice and this keeps a healthy balance on the player
                        doing what they want while they also traverse further
                        into the game.
