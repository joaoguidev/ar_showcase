                        The recurring theme throughout the story of Shin Megami
                        Tensei 1 is the idea of rebirth both on an individual
                        level and on a societal level. The English translation
                        of “Shin Megami Tensei” is “the rebirth/reincarnation of
                        the real/true goddess.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The story starts in modern-day Tokyo where recent
                        killings are slowly revealed to be an increasingly large
                        amount of rampaging demons. The first act ends when
                        Tokyo is nuked to kill all the demons, but after you
                        magically escape the blast and get transported 30 years
                        later you find the world to be in a post-apocalyptic
                        state, a battleground between the lawful and chaotic
                        factions, God and his angels versus Satan and his
                        demons. Depending on which, if any, faction you favor
                        you can get one of three different endings which will
                        decide how you remake the world: chaotic, lawful, or
                        neutral if you reject both sides of the conflict and
                        prefer a balance of both. In the neutral ending, which
                        is treated as the “true” ending by the fans, you restore
                        balance to the world, leaving the people to rebuild the
                        world without the influence of God or Satan.

                        One of the main mechanics in the game that are copied by
                        many of its successors in its genre is the idea of the
                        demons that you convince to help you throughout the game
                        can be combined together and reborn, stronger and better
                        than before in order to help you in battle. Many of the
                        characters you meet throughout the game die and are
                        reborn/reincarnated throughout the story, with one of
                        the most obvious examples being its Jesus allegory and
                        law-aligned party member, Yoshio, whose soul was ripped
                        out by a bad guy early in the game, but is resurrected
                        by God to be his new messiah, but might later be killed
                        by you if you choose to go down the neutral path. But
                        don’t feel too bad for him because the last thing that
                        is said to you during the end-credits of the neutral
                        path is that everyone who tragically died in the game
                        will be reborn: “They will all come back and be reborn,
                        just like I was. The destruction is finally over and the
                        time for creation and rebuilding has begun!”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The concept of being reborn is one of the central
                        recurring themes of this game. This theme is
                        demonstrated in the many characters who are revived
                        throughout the stories, through the game mechanics of
                        combining demons, allowing them to be reborn stronger
                        and better than ever, and even in the world, the story
                        takes place in. Even though a nuclear apocalypse has
                        happened and those who survived are fighting over the
                        ruins, there is still a chance to start again and make a
                        world even better than the last one. No matter how bad
                        things get or how impossible it looks to get back from
                        where we are, there is always a chance of starting again
                        and coming back better than before.
