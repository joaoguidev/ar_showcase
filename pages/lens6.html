                        Half-Life was full of crazy and huge enemies but for an
                        important moment of thinking nothing better comes to
                        mind then the tentacle monster found in the test launch
                        chamber. After the player attempts to go to the surface
                        for help, he encounters soldiers who instead of helping
                        are killing everything in their way, the player heads
                        back into the black mesa facility and soon encounters a
                        massive creature that uses hearing to attack.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The player is giving quite a few grenades after a
                        soldier from black mesa tells the player the monster is
                        using sounds so be quiet, my first thoughts were just to
                        be quiet and sneak through but many of the doorways of
                        ladder have objects in the way, using the crowbar would
                        be too loud and take too long. Players quickly realize
                        they could use the grenade loud explosion to break the
                        blockage and distract the monster, this plan works and
                        the player makes it pass the monster.

                        The players during this werenâ€™t told how to make it past
                        they were giving grenades and if the player stopped for
                        a second were told how the monster attacks but the
                        player had to think of their own way past the monster,
                        this can make a game harder for players because they
                        might not find the right answer but it also makes the
                        games more fun for the player instead of holding the
                        players hand and not getting the chance to think for
                        themselves, the player can figure things out, fail a
                        little but try again and then succeed and feel all the
                        better because they know they did it by themselves.
