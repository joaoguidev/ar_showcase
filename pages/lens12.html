                        From the get go the player is presented with a sense of
                        mystery and of being inserted into something important
                        as you are transported around the Black Mesa facilities
                        by a suspended train that moves you around. The sheer
                        scale of the laboratory and the nature of the brief
                        glances of what is being done there is enough to set the
                        mood of the game to come and therefore it is an
                        excellent beginning. The visual identity of the game ,
                        of course, given the hardware of the time, is remarkable
                        and recognizable up until today and proof of that is
                        that games and mods based on Half-Life were promptly
                        recognized and had a very distinct and unique look and
                        feel to it.

                        While underground the atmosphere is rich with scientists
                        speaking sciency language, constant announcements
                        through the speakers in rooms and hallways gives the
                        corporate feeling regarding the huge Black Mesa
                        corporation.. The sheer sense of the scale of the
                        underground installation is incredible. The player
                        really feels in a huge laboratory.

                        The atmosphere has to convey the science fiction aspect
                        of it while exploring the idea of a government cover up
                        of a major mishap and also the high tech corporative
                        style of Black Mesa while mixing it with an alien
                        invasion and succeeding in the mix. Given the fact that
                        this game was the genesis to several very good mods
                        sounds like health regeneration, the weird sound when
                        you press ‘e’ on a not interactable object and the
                        crowbar swing was broadly disseminated and it by itself
                        constitute an element that even when encountered in a
                        different game transports one’s mid to Half-Life. That’s
                        how memorable the atmosphere of the game was.
