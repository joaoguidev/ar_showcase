                        The storyline is precious and adds value to even the
                        parts that in other games the player might feel the urge
                        to skip it. The use of in game events instead of
                        cutscenes keeps the immersion and adds to the suspense
                        of the game as well as not taking the player's attention
                        away. The initial scene, where the player is arriving at
                        Black Mesa, had it been a cutscene the player would be
                        more distant, it would be less personal therefore taking
                        away from the value of it. Therefore been present, right
                        there and then, adds value to the experience. It is very
                        well implemented too. It is entertaining and constantly
                        there are things to look at. Moving boxes or robots
                        carrying their tasks while the player slides on the
                        train.

                        As mentioned on the lens of time, compartmentalizing the
                        game into chapters and small bits separated by events
                        makes possible a step by step experience shortening the
                        time between something happening therefore keeping the
                        player focused and always stimulated. This in itself
                        adds value to the experience and if a segment is not
                        pleasant to the player, it is just one of several
                        segments so the chances to bring back the player to a
                        situation where he/she sees value again are greater and
                        less far apart.
