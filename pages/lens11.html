                        Half-Life is an excellent example of keeping the
                        player's attention focused on the game by dividing it
                        into chapters and within these chapters advancing the
                        story by scripted events that happen as the player
                        progresses on the map. This works as a cue for the
                        player to inform that the plotline is advancing on that
                        segment but provides a larger expectation and curiosity
                        when it comes to going to the next chapter. This
                        technique keeps the player focused on the task at hand,
                        while with a larger goal in mind ( chapter change),
                        helped by the interesting storyline, essentially
                        vanishing the sense of time passing from the player's
                        senses while providing constant segmented feedback that
                        the player is advancing on the storyline.

                        This style of feeding the player with small bytes of
                        information, punctuated by in-game scripts as opposed to
                        cutscenes, grants a chance to extend the game length due
                        to the immersion and the will of wanting to keep
                        discovering the next bit of the storyline and see the
                        next script and on a broader expectation , get to the
                        next chapter. With that structure the game is on the
                        right measure of gameplay time while still intriguing
                        and interesting. The original Half Life even had 2
                        expansions and later a Half-Life 2.
