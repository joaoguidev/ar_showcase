                        Half life gave the player the free choice of how they
                        want to learn the story from the game. Like mentioned
                        previously like it were a real job you could either talk
                        to all your co-workers and find out what is happening or
                        you can learn yourself from doing what you want. Even
                        though in the end you were still following the same
                        story the way you found out about it was the way the
                        player wanted with their choices.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The game is made up from big open areas such as a
                        minefield all the way to crawling through vents. So some
                        places seemed a little concerning because you had to go
                        where the game wanted you but in other areas like the
                        minefield there were multiple ways and strategies to get
                        through without blowing up.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The best thing was the speed of the challenges and
                        puzzles that the player came across. Some of the players
                        are in a peaceful area and have time to think what they
                        want to try before they do it and other places they are
                        rained down by hectic gun fire and must think in the
                        moment. Either way the player can do what they deem is
                        right to survive and beat the game. The game isn't too
                        punishing if a player makes the wrong move because what
                        makes it so good is all the ways you can complete a
                        sector.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        So when you mess up you just die and respawn right where
                        you started to give it a go again. This helps the player
                        learn and get better and make better decisions later on
                        by adapting. The number of actions in the crucial areas
                        is what matters the most when it comes to games of that
                        era and half life did it perfectly.
