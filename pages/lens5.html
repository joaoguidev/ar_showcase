                        I’d say the memory of playing the games before is a bit
                        of a problem in the half life games when it comes to
                        immersion. There are a few times in the first half-life
                        that become more common in the later games, where you
                        are locked in a room with an npc who wants to have to
                        explain the plot to you, which is nowhere near as
                        immersive the second time ‘round. Unlike most modern
                        games which fade into tightly choreographed cutscenes
                        that make sure you see the scene in the best way
                        possible the half-life games leave you in full control
                        of your character, letting you misbehave and jump on
                        npc’s heads as they try to patiently convey their
                        exposition, never acknowledging the wacky things you are
                        doing out of fear they are encouraging you. Of course
                        this usually never happens on the first playthrough when
                        you are still fully immersed, but once you get to the
                        second and you already know everything they are going to
                        say this situation becomes a lot more common. Not only
                        does it destroy the tone the developers were intending,
                        but it damages your ability to take the world anywhere
                        near as seriously as the developers seem to want you to.
