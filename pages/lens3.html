                        One encounter that stands out in the original Half-life
                        is the first time you come across a member of the
                        military. The game spends a great while setting up the
                        anxiety of the Black Mesa staff about whether theyâ€™ll be
                        able to escape the facility and the hope they have that
                        the military will come in and save them. That makes the
                        moment when you first meet a soldier as they are in the
                        process of killing a soldier that shows you their hope
                        was misplaced. You now have seconds to react as what you
                        thought would be a bastion of hope becomes an enemy that
                        you must now kill in order to survive. This encounter
                        ends the first act of the Half-life, introduces a new
                        enemy type, and establishes a theme of justified
                        mistrust towards authority that will carry over to the
                        sequel.
